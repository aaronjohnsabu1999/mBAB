### Introduction

This web application provides users the ability to search for a word sequence, either case-sensitive or case-insensitive, across a user-specified set of books of the Holy Bible.  
The application is currently hosted at [this platform](http://aaronjs.pythonanywhere.com/).

This project was originally developed using Flask and has now been **rebuilt using Django** for improved scalability and maintainability.

### For the Developer...

#### Useful Links

* [Django Official Documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/)
* [Jinja Template and Syntax](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/templates/) (still used for templates)
* [Python SQLite3 Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html)

#### Installation of Necessary Packages

Tested on **Python 3.11+**.

You can set up the project as follows:

```bash
# Install virtualenv if needed
sudo apt install python3-venv

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Apply migrations (no models currently but necessary for Django)
python manage.py migrate

# Run the server
python manage.py runserver

#### Database Access

Presently I have removed databases from the corresponding directory in order to facilitate easier cloning of the repository. Feel free to download from or clone the repository on [Bible Databases](https://github.com/aaronjohnsabu1999/bible-databases)

### Possible additions and modifications
##### You are welcome to contribute by adding to this list (issues) or improving it (pull requests):

* Make the web application fully responsive for mobile devices (smaller than 1920Ã—1080 screens).
* Move controls into a collapsible sidebar for better usability.
* Add copyrighted versions such as NIV, NLT, and BSI Indian versions.
* Optionally introduce pagination for search results.
* Further subdivide the testaments by type (Law, History, Gospels, etc.).

* Improve UI/UX with more styling and theming.
* Enable optional user accounts to save search history.
